      <div class="text-about">
        I always think that
        my first approach with
        communication was with my first
        Nikon Coolpix. Since that moment
        I have never stopped recording and
        showing what I was doing. Maybe
        this background
        pushed me to continue my studies in
        Communication Design, where
        I discovered and expanded my knowledge.
        The projects I have
        worked on allowed me to
        improve soft skills, such as
        teamwork.
        My preferred language
        is reportage. For
        this reason I was been e-reporter for
        Fuorisalone.it for two
        consecutive years.
        I worked as a videomaker
        in some project, putting into practice
        different techniques, from video shooting
        to motion graphics.
        Iâ€™m interested in coding,
        from web design to development of
        video games.
