      <div class="text-about">
        I always like to think that
        my first approach with the
        communication originated from mine
        first digital machine, the
        Nikon Coolpix. From that moment
        I have not stopped recording and
        show what I was doing. And maybe
        this background that has me
        pushed to continue my studies in
        Communication design, where
        I discovered and expanded horizons
        cultural and above all visual.
        The many projects I have
        worked they allowed me to
        improve soft skills, such as
        teamwork.
        My personal language
        communicative is the reportage,
        tell stories through one
        organic series of photographs. For
        this reason I was for two
        e-reporter consecutive years for
        Fuorisalone.it, telling the
        Milan Design Week.
        I also got to
        tell about the "Food rule
        of art ", being part of the staff
        as a photographer and videomaker.
        I collaborated as a videomaker
        to some Design projects of the
        Product, putting into practice
        different techniques, from shooting up
        to motion graphics.
        I'm passionate about computer science,
        in particular coding, which al
        Polytechnic of Milan I succeeded
        to deepen in different fields,
        from site programming e
        web app, until the development of
        video games.
